# angular-extensive-demo
This Project is for demo. Just clone the project and do 'npm install' and then run the project using 'npm start' and open http://localhost:4200/ 
The port number 4200 can vary if it is already in use.
The project will take you to app/dashboard screen. For now only that is implemented.
